# Introduction

**Lokad.CQRS** is a **.NET framework** and a set of guidance materials for _building distributed and scalable applications_ to be **run on-premises or in the cloud**. This project helps to design and develop decoupled systems locally and bring them to the distributed environments later.

## Document Audience
This document targets developers that want to learn how to use Lokad.CQRS to prototype and develop _cloud-capable distributed_ systems with Microsoft .NET stack. It also might be helpful for .NET students who want to get guidance on building distributed and cloud systems.

It is advised to be familiar with the theory behind CQRS Architecture principles (http://abdullin.com/cqrs) and also be practically familiar with development on .NET 4.0 (serialization, parallel programming, LINQ, Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control, Unit Testing).

This document applies to the Lokad.CQRS v2.0 release (June 2011). We will be improving it in parallel with the samples and the framework itself. Please, make sure, that you got the latest version.

## Open-Source Strategy
Lokad.CQRS is an open source development framework released by Lokad SAS (http://lokad.com) for the community to use. As a start-up company we have benefitted a lot from a large number of various frameworks like Autofac, NUnit, ScrewTurn Wiki, ProtoBuf.NET, Math.NET and many more. These frameworks, shared under a liberal license, literally saved us thousands of man hours and allowed to achieve incredible results on the field of providing statistical forecasting as a service. 

Building distributed systems is neither the business focus of Lokad nor it is the critical competitive advantage. So we've decided to share some of our work and experience to say Thank You to incredible .NET community. 

Hopefully this project will help somebody to save a few man-hours, avoid a few pitfalls in building cloud systems and let focus resources and people on creating amazing products and services. It helps us.
